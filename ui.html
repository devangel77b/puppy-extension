    Guide dog puppies are placed with volunteer raisers at around 8 weeks of age, from whom they learn basic obedience, house manners, and socialization.  After formal harness training, they are placed with blind or visually impaired handlers.  Help give the gift of independence and mobility! Volunteer to raise a puppy, or donate today!
